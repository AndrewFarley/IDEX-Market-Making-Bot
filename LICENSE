That means you can do whatever you want with the code.

If you make money, I'd love to hear about it. But, seriously, just do whatever you want with it.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - THIS BOT SOMETIMES MAKES MONEY, AND SOMETIMES LOSES MONEY. YOU ARE 100% RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND ACTIONS. THIS CODE IS PRESENTED AS IS, WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

IDEX is a decentralized server and requires a private key for trading. Obviously, storing a private key on a node server has its own risks, and managing that security is up to you. I'd recommend using this as a starting point to customize your own code and strategies. As always, never run code you don't fully understand.
